# SoftwareCraftmanShipGuildProjects
Projects completed during my apprenticeship at the Software Craftsmanship Guild in Akron, OH - Dec, 2014 - March, 2015
Please note that this archive will be significantly updated once the apprenticeship is completed. If you would like to see any of my current works, I would be more than happy to share them with you. Those projects are currently held in a private repository. Once the apprenticeship is completed, these projects (and others) will be much more refined, and will be posted here.
